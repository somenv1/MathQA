 Concreteness is defined as a word's total amount of tangible words. High concreteness means a sentence has sufficient real objects and well-defined words that make a meaningful sentence with a high number of specifics. Low concreteness means a sentence has a large amount of abstract words and undefined objects that still make a meaningful sentence but lack a clear story. Use the given definition of concreteness and generate questions with high, medium and low concreteness based on the following information, 200 cats are in a cat park. 100 more cats show up at the cat park. 25% of the cats at the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  

**Possible answers:**

* **High concreteness:** "How many cats in the cat park are meowing?" This clearly define the number of cats we're looking for.
* **Medium concreteness:** "How many cats are meowing to show a certain percentage of them being meawing?" This requires knowing the total number of cats being meowing.
* **Low concreteness:** "What percent of the cats in a cat park are meowing?" This focuses on a general percentage and not the actual number of cats meowing.
