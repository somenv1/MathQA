 Concreteness is defined as a word's total amount of tangible words. High concreteness means a sentence has sufficient real objects and well-defined words that make a meaningful sentence with a high number of specifics. Low concreteness means a sentence has a large amount of abstract words and undefined objects that still make a meaningful sentence but lack a clear story. Use the given definition of concreteness and generate questions with high, medium and low concreteness based on the following information, 200 cats are in a cat park. 100 more cats show up at the cat park. 25% of the cats at the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  You could also write this as "How many cats from the 200 are meowing?"

**Question Format:**

*   **High Concreteness:** Using only specific, concrete numbers, ask how many.
*   **Medium Concreteness:** Ask using general quantifiers (many, some, a few) and avoid specific numbers. 
*   **Low Concreteness:**  Ask a question that's about a general concept of the total number, like how many out of that many.
