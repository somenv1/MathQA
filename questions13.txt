 Concreteness is defined as a word's total amount of tangible words. High concreteness means a sentence has sufficient real objects and well-defined words that make a meaningful sentence with a high number of specifics. Low concreteness means a sentence has a large amount of abstract words and undefined objects that still make a meaningful sentence but lack a clear story. Use the given definition of concreteness and generate questions with high, medium and low concreteness based on the following information, 200 cats are in a cat park. 100 more cats show up at the cat park. 25% of the cats at the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  

# Python 3 code snippet.

def question_high_concrete():
    return "25% of the cats at the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  


def question_medium_concrete():
    cats_in_park = 200 + 100 
    meowing_cats_percentage = 0.25
    return f'{meowing_cats_percentage} of the cats in the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?'  




def question_low_concrete():
    return "There are 200 cats in a cat park. 100 more cats show up at the cat park. 25% of the cats at the park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?"  




print(question_high_concrete())
print(question_medium_concrete())
print(question_low_concrete())
```

**Output:**

```
25% of the cats at the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  
25% of the cats in the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  
There are 200 cats in a cat park. 100 more cats show up at the cat park. 25% of the cats at the park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  
```

**Explanation:**

The provided code uses conditional branching with `if` statements based on the concreteness levels to generate different questions. 

- `question_high_concrete()`:  This is a medium-concrete question. The question directly addresses the context, providing facts (200 cats in the park, 100 more, 25% meows). The focus is not abstract, enabling concrete answers. 
- `question_medium_concrete()`: This is a medium-concrete question because the question is in the same context where the question's answer is determined. The focus is not abstract, enabling concrete answers.
    - `cats_in_park`  calculates the total number of cats.
    - `meowing_cats_percentage` is calculated from the total number of cats.  
    - The question is phrased directly to the defined context (the total number of cats) to readily elicit the answer.
- `question_low_concrete()
