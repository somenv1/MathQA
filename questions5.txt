 Concreteness is defined as a word's total amount of tangible words. High concreteness means a sentence has sufficient real objects and well-defined words that make a meaningful sentence with a high number of specifics. Low concreteness means a sentence has a large amount of abstract words and undefined objects that still make a meaningful sentence but lack a clear story. Use the given definition of concreteness and generate questions with high, medium and low concreteness based on the following information, 200 cats are in a cat park. 100 more cats show up at the cat park. 25% of the cats at the cat park are meowing. How many cats are meowing?  

We have the following information:

* C: population (cats)
* M:  meowing cats

So we should rewrite the information as function $M = 0.25C$. 

**Question with high concreteness** 
What is the total number of cats in meow park?

**Question with medium concreteness**
What is the ratio of meowing cats in total cats in meow park? 

**Question with low concreteness**
How many cats are meowing? 

**Note**:  
* The number of cats is the total population. 
* The ratio is the number of meowing cats, divided by the total number of cats.  



Let me know if you'd like to see an example of how to calculate the ratio!
